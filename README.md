*Store Sales Dashboard using Power BI*
Objective:
To create a comprehensive, interactive Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into store sales performance, enabling businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), evaluate profitability, and make informed decisions based on sales trends, segments, shipping modes, and geographical data.

Synopsis:
This Power BI project showcases a dynamic store sales dashboard built using a fictional retail dataset. The dashboard integrates multiple visual elements such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and a map to analyze and visualize sales, profit, quantity sold, shipping efficiency, customer segments, categories, and regional performance.
The project focuses on Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis, segment-wise sales distribution, shipping preferences, and sub-category profitability. It equips stakeholders with the ability to identify top-performing products, regions, and payment modes, while also providing a drill-down capability for deeper insights.
